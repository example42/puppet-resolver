#
# Standard class parameters

#
# [*puppi_helper*]
#   Specify the helper to use for puppi commands. The default for this module
#   is specified in params.pp and is generally a good choice.

#   managed by Puppet.
#   Can be defined also by the (top scope) variables $resolver_audit_only
#   and $audit_only
#
# Default class params - As defined in resolver::params.
# Note that these variables are mostly defined and used in the module itself,
# overriding the default values might not affected all the involved components.
# Set and override them only if you know what you're doing.
# Note also that you can't override/set them via top scope variables.
#
# [*config_file*]
#   Main configuration file path
#
# [*config_file_mode*]
#   Main configuration file path mode
#
